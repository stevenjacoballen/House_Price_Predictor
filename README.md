# Project Intro
This Project utilizes Regression models to predict housing prices in the Seattle area based on sales data from 2014-2015.

In this case, the Linear Regression model ultimately performs best, and consequently, the four assumptions of Linear Regression are tested. After finding that two of the assumptions are violated, the label data price is log-transformed, the Linear Regression model is retrained, the assumptions are re-tested, and a final analysis is conducted.
